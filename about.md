### Education
- Ph.D. Student. University of Washington, School of Medicine, Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, Biomedical and Health Informatics, Sept. 2015- Present
- B.E.		Yonsei University, Colleage of Engineering, Department of Computer Science

### Employment

- Sept. 2016 - Present : Teaching Assistant, Department of Computer Science, Machine Learning (CSE546)

- June. 2016 - Sept. 2016 : Research Intern, Microsoft Research (Mentor: Eric Horvitz)

> The work for predicting Intensive Care Unit(ICU) Mortality were continued. By using computational resrouces in Microsoft Research, we were able to develop an approach that could predict the ICU mortality which is concordant to medical consensus.

- Sept. 2015 - June. 2016 : Predoctoral Research Assistant, Mooney Group<mooneygroup>, University of Washington

> I mostly worked on building pipelines using Whole Exome Sequencing Data. We developed a pipeline that use both pathogenic variants with solid evidence and variants that are likely to be pathogenic based on predictions.

- July. 2015 - Sept. 2015 : Research Intern, Microsoft Research (Mentor: Eric Horvitz)

> I first exposed to the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. We researched the topic 'failure to death', and come up with a feature engineering method that could quantify the sustainment of each variable during past observation within predefined window size.

- Sept. 2014 - July 2015 : Predoctoral Research Assistant, Sauro Lab<saurogroup>, University of Washington

> Worked as a part of Synthetic Biology Open Language Standard Group. In addition, I developed a Tinkercell plugin to adopt SBOL 1.1.

- Sept. 2013 - Sept. 2014 : Researcher, Biomedical Informatics Lab, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea
-  June 2012 - May 2013 : Undergraduate Intern, Embedded and Bio database Laboratory, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea
- May 2008 - August 2008 : Distributed System Researcher,Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Science, Espoo, Finland, FKII, Finland-Korea Internship Exchange Program, 
 - April 2009 - August 2009 : Developer, INSCO, Seoul, Korea (Startup Venture)
 -  March 2006 - June 2006 : Algorithm Instructor, SangA Computer Institute, Incheon, Korea
