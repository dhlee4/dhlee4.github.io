### Education
- Ph.D. Student. University of Washington, School of Medicine, Department of Biomedical Informatics and Medical Education, Biomedical and Health Informatics, Sept. 2015- Present
	- Research Interest: Machine learning application on clinical data
	- Supervisor: Dr. Meliha Yetisgen
- B.E.		Yonsei University, Colleage of Engineering, Department of Computer Science

### Research Experience

- June. 2016 - Sept. 2016 : Research Intern, Microsoft Research (Mentor: Eric Horvitz)

> The work for predicting Intensive Care Unit(ICU) mortality was continued. We developed the approach that could predict the ICU mortality which is concordant to medical consensus. Physionet ICU Challenge data was used, and Apache SPARK was used for the computational framework.

- Sept. 2015 - June. 2016 : Predoctoral Research Assistant, Mooney Group<mooneygroup>, University of Washington

> I mostly worked on building pipelines using Whole Exome Sequencing Data. We developed a pipeline that use both pathogenic variants with solid evidence and variants that are likely to be pathogenic based on predictions.

- July. 2015 - Sept. 2015 : Research Intern, Microsoft Research (Mentor: Eric Horvitz)

> I first exposed to the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. We researched the topic 'failure to death', and come up with a feature engineering method that could quantify the sustainment of each variable during past observation within predefined window size.

- Sept. 2014 - July 2015 : Predoctoral Research Assistant, Sauro Lab<saurogroup>, University of Washington

> Worked as a part of Synthetic Biology Open Language Standard Group. In addition, I developed a Tinkercell plugin to adopt SBOL 1.1.

- Sept. 2013 - Sept. 2014 : Researcher, Biomedical Informatics Lab, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea
-  June 2012 - May 2013 : Undergraduate Intern, Embedded and Bio database Laboratory, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea
- May 2008 - August 2008 : Distributed System Researcher, Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Science, Espoo, Finland, FKII, Finland-Korea Internship Exchange Program,
