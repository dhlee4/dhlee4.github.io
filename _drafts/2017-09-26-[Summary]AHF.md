> In most cases, AHF arises as a result of deterioration in patients with a previous diagnosis of HF
> Can be caused by an abnormality of any aspects of cardiac function(Appendix A)
> In patients with pre-existing HF there is often a clear precipitant or trigger
>> Rapid arrhythmia or severe bradycardia/conduction disturbance

>> Acute coronary syndrome

>> Mechanical complication of acute coronary syndrome

>> Acute pulmonary Embolism

>> Hypertensive Crisis

>> Cardiac Tamponade

>> Aortic dissection

>> Surgery and perioperative problems

>> Peripartum cadiomyopathy

>The key drugs are oxygen, diuretics, and vasodilators
> Opiates and inotropes are used more selectively, and mechanical support of the circulation is required only rarely.
> Non-invasive ventilation is used commonly, but invasive ventilation is required in only a minority of patients.

#Pharmacological therapy
 > Oxygen
 >> to treat hypoxaemia
 
 >> extended oxygen in non-hypoxaemic patients causes vasoconstriction and a reduction in cardiac output
 

> Diuretics
>> When pulmonary edema is undelying cause, patients with dyspnoea caused by PE obtain rapid symptomatic relief from administration of an i.v. diuretic, as a result of both an immediate venodilator action and subsequent removal of fluid

>> In patients with resistant peripheral edema(and ascites), a combination of a loop and a thiazide or thiazide-like diuretic may be needed to achieve an adequate diuresis.
>>> Potential side effect: Hypokalemia, renal dysfunction, and hypovolaemia

>Opiates

>> Useful with acute pulmonary edema as they reduce anxiety and relieve distress associated with dyspnoea.

>> Also thought to be venodilators, reducing preload, and may also reduce sympathetic drive

>>> Potential Side effect: nausea, depress respiratory drive(potentially increasing the need for invasive ventilation)

> Vasodilators

>> reduce preload and afterload and increase stroke volume
>> most useful in patients with hypertension and should be avoided in patients with a SBP < 110 mmHg

> Nesiritide
>> a human BNP that acts mainly as a vasodilator

> Inotropes

>> usually be reserved for patients with severe reductio nin cardiac output that vital organ perfusion is compromised. Such patients are hypotensive.

>>>Potential side effect: sinus tachycardia, myocardial ischaemia and arrhythmia

> Vasopressors
>> given to severely ill patients with marked hypotension.
>> rais BP and redistribute cardiac output from the extremities to the vital organs
>>> Potential Side Effect: increase in LV afterload, similar adverse effects to inotropes.

> Dopamine
>> inotropic and vasoconstrictor activity.
>>>Potential side effect: hypoxaemia

> Other 
>> Thrombo-embolism prophylaxis with anticoagulant should be used.

#Non-pharmacological therapy
> Ventilation
> Mechanical circulatory support
>> IABP
>> Ventricular assist device
>> Ultrafiltration

#Side comments
 - How many of these procedures are specifically given to patients with AHF? For example, PE is shared with ARF.
