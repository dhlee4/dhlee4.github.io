#Pucher, P. H., & Aggarwal, R. (2014). Failure to Rescue. JAMA surgery, 149(7), 747-747.

 - Silber raised concern around the work of Gonzalez et al., which report failure-to-rescue rates in cardiovascular surgery wrere lower in high-volume hospitals that in low-volume hospitals.
 - They did not count every death of a patient undergoing CABG
	 - 63% of study population admitted for CABG, and patients who experienced an AMI and subsequently died were not counted as a death, and therefore excluded from their FTR analysis
 - Suggested Direction
	 - They should provide a full account of
		 1. All death including who died without an AMI complication
		 2. all patients with complications(including those who had an AMI)
		 3. the FTR rate based on all patients
