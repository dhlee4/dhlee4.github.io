#Tolwani, A. (2012). Continuous renal-replacement therapy for acute kidney injury. New England Journal of Medicine, 367(26), 2505-2514.

 - There exists consensus around AKF(AKI)
	 - Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes(KDIGO)

> Increase in the serum creatinine leel of 0.3 mg per deciliter or more within 48 hrs, Serum Creatinine level that has increased by at least 1.5 times the baseline value within the previous 7 days, or a urine volume of less than 0.5 ml per kilogram of body weight per hour for 6 hrs


> Acute tubular necrosis is the most common cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury


> Usually, AKI was managed with intermittent HD
	
- Exists the risk of systemic hypotension -> 10% of AKI patients cannot be treated because of hemodynamic instability[11-15]
- Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration is a different form of CRRT


 > CRRT can be discontinued once renal recovery has been confirmed or the decision is made to switch to another form of renal replacement because of the patient's clinical condition

 > The average cost of continuous renal-replacement therapy per patient was scalculated to be $8,052 over a mean length of stay of 17 days[55]

#Side Comments
 - ARDS has Berlin Definition
 - What is driving factor of deciding HD vs. CRRT?
 - Is there any reason patients who are hemo-dynamicaly stable not receive CRRT in ICU setting, besides cost?
