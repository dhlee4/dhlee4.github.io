#Bernal, W., Auzinger, G., Dhawan, A., & Wendon, J. (2010). Acute liver failure. The Lancet, 376(9736), 190-201.

> The clinical presentation usually includes hepatic dysfunction, abnormal liver biochemical values, and coagulopathy; encephalopathy may develop, with multiorgan failure and death occurring in up to half the cases[1-3]

 - Why do I see more Acute liver necrosis even in MIMIC3 dataset?

>More modern definitions recognize distinct disease phenotypes and
quantify the interval between the onset of symptoms and the development of encephalopathy[7]

>In hyperacute cases, this interval is a week or less, and the cause is usually acetaminophen toxicity or a viral infection
 - Hep A, B and E for Viral Infection

>Acute liver failure is much less common in the developed world than in the developing world, where viral infections (hepatitis A, B, and E) are the predominant causes.Public health measures (e.g., vaccination and improved sanitation) are among the factors resulting in the reduced incidence of these infections in the United States and much of Western Europe, where drug-induced liver injury is the most common cause of acute liver failure.


>Drug-induced liver injury is responsible for approximately 50% of cases of acute liver failure in the United States.[16,17]

 - acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity


>Acetylcysteine has complex antioxidant and immunologic effects that may also benefit patients with nonâ€“acetaminophen-related acute liver failure.

Subsequent Care
>since specific therapies may be available for some causes of acute liver failure (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).

- Need to check this


Treatment
>The goal of treatment is to achieve overall metabolic and hemodynamic stability, with the reasonable, though yet unproven, idea that such therapy will greatly improve conditions for hepatic regeneration and minimize the risk of complications.

 - Mainly focusing on support liver function while waiting for native recovery while minimizing the risk of complication

>Hepatocyte transplantation involves intraportal or intraperitoneal infusion of isolated human hepatocytes to augment liver function. The procedure has been used successfully in neonates

>to support the failing liver through the removal of circulating toxic mediators, to stabilize the clinical conditions of the patients while they await definitive transplantation, or to facilitate native liver regeneration.

#Side Comments
 - Maybe there exists some interventions which showed better outcome in liver failure? Verify the efficacy of Acetylcysteine on ALF?
 - How does it manifests with the relationship with other OFs?
	 - And Corresponding the risk of mortality?
